# RSA, Caesar Cipher, and Diffie-Hellman Algorithms with Python

This repository contains code and explanations for the RSA, Caesar Cipher, and Diffie-Hellman algorithms written in Python. All of the code is presented in Jupyter Notebook format (`.ipynb` files).

## Contents

The repository includes the following 4 Jupyter Notebooks:

1. RSA Algorithm
    - URL: [https://github.com/ChunKit99/encryption-algorithm-in-python/blob/main/RSA_algorithm.ipynb](https://github.com/ChunKit99/encryption-algorithm-in-python/blob/main/RSA_algorithm.ipynb)
    
2. Caesar Cipher Algorithm
    - URL: [https://github.com/ChunKit99/encryption-algorithm-in-python/blob/main/Caesar_cipher_algorithm.ipynb](https://github.com/ChunKit99/encryption-algorithm-in-python/blob/main/Caesar_cipher_algorithm.ipynb)
    
3. Diffie-Hellman Algorithm
    - URL: [https://github.com/ChunKit99/encryption-algorithm-in-python/blob/main/Diffie_Hellman_Algorithm.ipynb](https://github.com/ChunKit99/encryption-algorithm-in-python/blob/main/Diffie_Hellman_Algorithm.ipynb)
    
4. RSA Calculation
    - URL: [https://github.com/ChunKit99/encryption-algorithm-in-python/blob/main/RSA.ipynb](https://github.com/ChunKit99/encryption-algorithm-in-python/blob/main/RSA.ipynb)
    
## Usage

To run these notebooks, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can find installation instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install).

Once Jupyter Notebook is installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/ChunKit99/encryption-algorithm-in-python.git
```

After cloning the repository, navigate to the repository directory and start Jupyter Notebook with the following command:
```
jupyter notebook
```

This will open Jupyter Notebook in your web browser, and you can open the desired `.ipynb` file to view and run the code.
